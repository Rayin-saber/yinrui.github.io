I am currently a research fellow at Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, working with <a href="https://avillach-lab.hms.harvard.edu/">Dr. Paul Avillach</a> to apply machine learning-based methods to clinical and genomic datasets to discover subgroups of diseases. I received my Ph.D. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervison of <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asckkwoh/">Dr. Kwoh Chee Keong</a>. My thesis is meta-analysis on the lethality of influenza A viruses using machine learning approaches with dissertation advisory committee members <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/boan/index.html">Assoc. Professor Bo An</a>,  <a href="https://sentic.net/erikcambria/">Assoc. Professor Erik Cambria</a> and <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/sinnopan/">Assoc. Professor Sinno Jialin Pan</a>. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree and master's degree in Shandong University and Central South University in China, respectively.
