I am a tenure-track assistant professor (AI Initiative) at the Department of Health Outcome and Biomedical Informatics, University of Florida. I completed my postdoctoral training at the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, working with <a href="https://avillach-lab.hms.harvard.edu/">Dr. Paul Avillach</a>. Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University of Singapore in 2020, under the supervision of <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asckkwoh/">Dr. Kwoh Chee Keong</a>. My thesis is meta-analysis on the lethality of influenza A viruses using machine learning approaches, examined by the dissertation advisory committee members <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/">Professor Bo An</a>,  <a href="https://sentic.net/erikcambria/">Professor Erik Cambria</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~sinnopan/">Professor Sinno Jialin Pan</a>. I obtained my bachelor's degree and master's degree from Shandong University and Central South University in 2013 and 2015, respectively.
